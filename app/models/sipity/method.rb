  # We store, in the database, the 'service_name'. It is the name of a constant
  # in the object space (e.g. we constantize the given service_name). The
  # resolving service object should specify that `it_behaves_like "a Hyrax workflow method"`
  #
  # @see ./lib/hyrax/specs/shared_specs/workflow_method.rb
  # @see Sipity::WorkflowAction
  # @see Hyrax::Workflow::ActionTakenService to see how this is used.
